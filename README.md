## History

Rawmusic.co.uk was founded by Raphael, Steph and Romain in 2005 as a community to **freely** release our music under the CreativeCommons in the pre-Soundcloud, pre-Bandcamp era. At our brightest we proudly hosted 20+ musical acts coming from many parts of the world, several live radio shows and a little chatroom. Our netlabel had no specific style: the only thing we had in comon was the rawness of our music - untouched by any sort of commercial interest; the only rule was to make all your published songs sources available for other rawmusic.co.uk artists to remix. This led to many creative and interesting projects which would have never existed otherwise. The website evolved over the years, and at one point there were much more ambitious plans which never saw the light. Overtime most of us signed up to Soundcloud and Bandcamp, some kept making music. One day our domain name expired, our small hosting server got used for another project and without anyone really realizing, rawmusic.co.uk was gone.

## And now?

After years of cyber-squatting, the domain was ours to claim back for a reasonable price. An archive of *most* of the original songs was made and will soon be available to enjoy. It'll be the 20th anniversary spring/summer 2025, we could organize a party and press some EPs :)
